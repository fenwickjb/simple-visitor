This code very closely matches the lecture slides example.

(I can't help but "refactor" every time I touch this code!)

(And I've combined related classes into single files to keep the
number of files small. So all Node classes are in the 
one Node.java file.)

But it works. Just do 2 steps:
1. Compile everything: javac *.java
2. Run main: java Client

Want to fiddle a bit to learn? Try:
1. current tree built is 3 nodes, maybe add a 4th and 5th?
2. add println to traverser to "see" the order of the traversal
3. add a different traversal method
   3a. perhaps a DepthFirstTraversal, "stack up the left side first
       then the current node, then the right side"
4. add a different Node type
   4a. maybe a StringNode 
5. add a different Visitor purpose: 
   5a. total all the IntNodes
   5b. concatenating all String nodes (if did 4a above)
